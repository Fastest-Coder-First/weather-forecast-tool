Weather Forecasting Tool - Usage of GitHub Copilot

This project demonstrates the usage of GitHub Copilot in different scenarios for creating a command line weather forecasting tool. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant developed by OpenAI that can help with auto-completion, code generation, and error handling.

Usage of GitHub Copilot in this project:

1. API Usage:
   - GitHub Copilot helped in generating the base URL and query parameters for making requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - It assisted in structuring the API key handling and authentication for accessing weather data.

2. Data Parsing:
   - GitHub Copilot suggested the structure of the JSON response from the OpenWeatherMap API, including accessing temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed.
   - It helped in handling JSON decoding errors using the `json.JSONDecodeError` exception.

3. Error Handling:
   - GitHub Copilot provided suggestions for handling HTTP errors, such as `urllib.error.HTTPError`, when retrieving weather data from the API.
   - It assisted in handling connection errors, like `urllib.error.URLError`, when the tool failed to connect to the weather service.

By leveraging the power of GitHub Copilot, this weather forecasting tool was developed more efficiently with accurate suggestions, reducing the need for manual coding and ensuring robust error handling.
